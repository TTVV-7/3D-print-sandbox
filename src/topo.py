"""A topographic map: a patch of the real world as a relief, with its ocean,
lakes and rivers in a second colour and a pin standing on each place you name.

    parts, info = topo.build(pins=["Squamish", "49.6847, -123.1558"])
    parts, info = topo.build(centre="Lake Louise", span=12, size=150)

Three kinds of data go into it, all of them fetched on demand and none of
them needing a key:

- **The ground** is the AWS Terrain Tiles' Terrarium PNGs: the whole world's
  elevation, SRTM and friends merged, as 256-pixel tiles whose red, green and
  blue are the height in metres.  Down to about 5 m a pixel.
- **The water** is OpenStreetMap, as OpenFreeMap's vector tiles in the
  OpenMapTiles schema: the `water` layer's polygons (ocean, lakes, wide
  rivers) and the `waterway` layer's lines (rivers, canals and streams).
  Decoded here by a forty-line protobuf reader rather than a dependency.
- **The pins** are places by name, looked up on OpenStreetMap's Nominatim
  (or Photon, when Nominatim is busy), or latitude, longitude pairs given
  straight.

The relief is a heightfield on a regular grid, closed into a solid with walls
and a floor.  Water is the awkward part: a lake's surface should be flat and
an ocean's at sea level, while the elevation data under them is whatever the
survey made of a reflective surface.  So the grid carries three surfaces --
the ground, the water's surface, and the floor the water sits on -- and the
water is the vector outline, cut between the floor and the surface.  The land
is the ground with that taken out.  Every water body is at least `depth` mm
of its own colour, so it prints as a layer of blue rather than a speck, and
a river narrower than the grid still comes out the width you asked for,
because its outline is the vector line, not a run of grid cells.

The parts are the same shape as cards.build()'s -- land in the body slot,
water in the pattern slot, pins in the primary slot -- so the plate, the 3MF,
the STL and the app's viewer take them unchanged.

Elevation: Mapzen / AWS Terrain Tiles (SRTM, GMTED, ETOPO1, NED and others).
Water and places: (c) OpenStreetMap contributors, via OpenFreeMap and
Nominatim.
