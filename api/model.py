"""The generators as a Vercel function, at /api/model.

Vercel's api/ directory is file-based: this file answers /api/model, which is
the path the page calls whether it is talking to Vercel or to src/app.py.  It
runs the BaseHTTPRequestHandler subclass it finds *defined* here under the
name `handler` -- that look is static, so importing src/app.py's Handler under
the name was not enough: the file built as nothing, silently, until the class
was written out.  The page itself is public/index.html, served as a static
file.
